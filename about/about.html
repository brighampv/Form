    <h1>Learn more about me</h1>
    <p>You can <a href="https://www.phvillanueva.com/html/about.html">click here to find out more!!!</a> and if you
      don't want to learn about me, here's a story about headphones <strong>STORY TIME!!!</strong><br><br>
      So headphones. A few years ago, Airpods came out and I thought they were stupid. I came home, my parents gave me
      one (because because) and I ended up loving them!!</p>

    <p>To an extent.</p>


    <p>
      So most people use headphones to like detract themselves from society and, you know, mind their own business
      listening to whatever their bops are. And I have nothing against bops or jams. But for me, I use headphones as a
      way to be invisible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever you see someone with headphones on, unless you know them, you don't bother talking to them and often even
      ignore them because you assume they don't care. Fair assumption? So sometimes I use my Airpods/headphones to not
      just listen to music, but I turn off my music and just listen to whatever's going on around me. And because I have
      my headphones on, no one pays any attention to me, and if I do I take off one headphone and say
    </p>

    <p>"Sorry, what was that?"</p>
    <p>

      Not too often, of course, cuz that's creepy... and sorta like eavesdropping. (It's exactly like eavesdropping).
      Sorry, not sorry? Almost always I'd rather listen to my music anyway. But there were times in my life when this
      came in handy.
    </p>

    <p>At the airport heading home from my mission.</p>

    <p>
      When I was at the airport I wanted to talk to someone but no one wanted to because usually, richer people are
      shyer and less likely to talk to me. I actually tried talking to someone and well it didn't pan out... plus with
      Covid-19 just starting, it was a rough time. So I put on
      my headphones and listened to some Lofi songs for a while. When I did this I kept looking into myself. I was
      dwelling on
      my fears and my worries. I decided to turn off the music. Look for silence and listen to what the spirit is
      telling me to do. And here's what I heard
    </p>

    <p>Child 1: Mom, can we come back? I wanna see my friends again. Do you think I'll see them again?</p>

    <p>Adult 1: Yeah my husband was furloughed because apparently, they didn't need him anymore</p>

    <p>Adult 2: what do you mean borders are closed? what about my family?</p>

    <p>Adult 3: Anak (Child) Shhh!! don't cough, they'll hear you</p>

    <p>Child 2: is there any water? Dad, I need to pee!</p>

    <p>Adult 4: -Divorced a while back. But I didn't find anyone here either.</p>
    <p>

      I turned my songs back on. And suddenly, I don't feel like my problems are all that daunting. I mean I know my
      life isn't the best one, I know it's not put together in the right way sometimes, but I think at that time the
      spirit was telling me that I'm not the only one dealing with crap. Everyone around me is going through something,
      and though it's clear a lot of them don't want to talk about, that doesn't mean it's not there. I turned on my
      music and felt pain. Not for myself but for them. I don't even know them. But I hope all is well.
